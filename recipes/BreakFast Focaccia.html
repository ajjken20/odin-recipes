    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, yeast, 2 tsp salt in a large mixing bowl. Add warm water and 2 tbsp of the olive oil. Using
            clean hands, bring mixture together to form a wet and sticky dough. Add a little more oil to bowl and grease
            mixing bowl. Turn dough in bowl to coat. Cover and set aside in a warm place until it doubles in size
            (approx 1 hour)</li>
        <li>Pour remaining olive oil into a large 30cm x 40cm baking dish and swirl to coat evenly</li>
        <li>Punch dough to expel air and place inside oiled baking dish. Using your fingertips, stretch the dough to the
            edges. Cover again and set aside in a warm place to puff up, (approx 30 minutes)</li>
        <li>Arrange oven rack in a middle postion of the oven and preheat oven 240c</li>
        <li>Using the base of a small glass dusted in flour, press down into dough to make 8 evenly spaced indents. Open
            out indents more by pushing the dough back with your fingers. Sprinkle with 2tsp sea salt and scatter over
            cheese, bacon, onion and rosemary around the indents.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes. Remove from oven and press the same glass into the indents to make them deeper. Crack 1 egg
            into each indent. Bake for a further 7-9 minutes or until egg whites are set and yokes runny. Serve warm
